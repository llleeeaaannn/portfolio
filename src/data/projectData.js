  longDescription: 'Stockle is a static, client-side only web application built on vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. Stockle was built to function almost identically to the popular game Wordle. Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. Stockle relies on the same concept but rather than using any five-letter word the potential answers are stock tickers of various lengths and the UI and game logic dynamically adjusts to the ticker length of the day. The purpose of Stockle is to allow financial market participants and enthusiats to play a fun and mentally stimulating stock related game which also exposes them to new stocks and companies they were otherwise unaware of.',

  goals: ["From its inception I was an avid user of the popular word based game, Wordle. Myself and my friends played it everyday without fail. Upon the game being sold to the New York Times, a friend asked me would it have been expensive or difficult to develop. I explained that although the idea and implementation were fantastic, it was a relatively simple static site with even the future daily answers pre-loaded.", "This discussion gave me the idea to develop my own version of Wordle. I am very passionate about finance and am active in many investment communities online. I therefore decided to build a version of Wordle which would use stock tickers rather than 5 letter words.", "My goals for this project were to design and implement a lightweight static web application with all of the features provided by the original Wordle. The application would have further logic built on top of tjhe original features owing to the use of stock tickers of various lengths (in comparison to Worlde where all answers are 5 letters long). Furthermore, I wanted the styling of Stockle to be identical to that of Wordle in order to bring a familiarity."],

The setlist.fm REST API is called to retrieve a response containing the necessary data on the user's chosen setlist. The data is then parsed and numerous methods are called to convert the data into the required format. The Spotify API's Search endpoint is called to reteive a unique URI for each track. Tracks which weren't found on Spotify are added to an object to be returned to the client alongside the playlist. Finally the playlist is created througha POST request to and populated with each track (through their respective URI).

Rather than displaying live prices in dollars, the call and put prices are provided as a percentage of the value of basket of underlying assets that they represent.
