  shortDescription: 'A Wordle-like game with over 500 weekly users which uses stock tickers instead of words.',
  longDescription: 'Stockle is a static, client-side only web application built on vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. Stockle was built to function almost identically to the popular game Wordle. Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. Stockle relies on the same concept but rather than using any five-letter word the potential answers are stock tickers of various lengths and the UI and game logic dynamically adjusts to the ticker length of the day. The purpose of Stockle is to allow financial market participants and enthusiats to play a fun and mentally stimulating stock related game which also exposes them to new stocks and companies they were otherwise unaware of.',
