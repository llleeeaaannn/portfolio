  longDescription: "Stockle is a static, client-side-only web application built on vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS and SCSS. Stockle was built to function almost identically to the popular game Wordle. Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of coloured tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. Stockle relies on the same concept but rather than using any five-letter word the potential answers are stock tickers of various lengths and the UI and game logic dynamically adjust to the ticker length of the day. The purpose of Stockle is to allow financial market participants and enthusiasts to play a fun and mentally stimulating stock market related game which also exposes them to new stocks and companies they were otherwise unaware of.",

  goals: ["From its release, I was an avid user of the popular word-based game, Wordle. My friends and I played it every day without fail. Upon the game being sold to the New York Times, a friend asked me would it have been expensive or difficult to develop. I explained that although the idea and implementation were fantastic, it was a relatively simple static site with even the future daily answers pre-loaded.", "This discussion gave me the idea to develop my own version of Wordle. I am very passionate about finance and am active in many investment communities online. I, therefore, decided to build a version of Wordle which would use stock tickers rather than 5 letter words.", "My goals for this project were to design and implement a lightweight static web application with all of the features provided by the original Wordle. The application would have further logic built on top of the original features owing to the use of stock tickers of various lengths (in comparison to Worlde where all answers are 5 letters long). Furthermore, I wanted the styling of Stockle to be identical to that of Wordle to bring a sense of familiarity."],

Users' theme preference is stored in their browser's Local Storage allowing Stockle to present it by default on future visits.", "Statistic tracking, including wins, games played, results and win streak, are stored in the browser's local storage allowing tracking of user's scores without necessitating a cumbersome login which could negatively influence user adoption and is unnecessary for such simple game.", "After each game, the user can 'Share' their result through the application generated and formatted text."],

Spotlist's front end is built in Javascript on the React framework. Spotlist's backend is a Node.js server built on the Express framework, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and accessed through AWS's API Gateway.

  goals: ["As somebody who goes to many concerts, I always like to find the artist's setlist and listen to it so I know all the songs they'll play. To do this I use setlist.fm, a site with user-generated concert setlists, to find the latest setlist and then I manually add each song to a Spotify playlist. This allows me to play the setlist, in order, whenever is convenient to me.", "Although this technique works for me, it is quite cumbersome. I'm forced to check the next song name in the setlist.fm tab on my browser, switch to the Spotify app, search for the song, add it to the playlist and rinse and repeat.", "With most setlists being upwards of 20 songs, this can take me over 10 minutes each time. I decided to save myself 10 minutes and instead spend days developing a web application which would automate the entire process", "I aimed to build a lightweight Progressive Web App which could be installed on users' devices. The application would connect to the user's Spotify account and accept a setlist.fm setlist link. The application would call setlist.fm's REST API to retrieve setlist data including artist, songs, date, location... Said data would then be converted to a format accepted by Spotify's API. A Spotify playlist would be created in the user's account with each song added sequentially", "Finally a link to the playlist would be returned to the user, while the playlist will also be present in the user's Spotify account.

  "Spotlist has a Node.js backend built on the Express.js framework. The backend has two main purposes.", "Firstly, it is used to authorise the user's Spotify account. This is achieved by requesting a login URL from Spotify and returning it to the client upon which the user is redirected to Spotify's login page to authorise the app. Upon successful authorisation, the Express.js server requests an access token from Spotify which is valid for 30 minutes and is used for subsequent requests to Spotify's API until it expires.",
  "Following authorisation, the backend is also called when the user attempts to create a playlist. The 'setlist' route receives a HTTP request including a setlist ID and a Spotify Access token. The setlist.fm REST API is called to retrieve a response containing the necessary data on the user's chosen setlist. The data is then parsed and numerous methods are called to convert the data into the required format. The Spotify API's Search endpoint is called to retrieve a unique URI for each track. Tracks which weren't found on Spotify are added to an object to be returned to the client alongside the playlist. Finally, the playlist is created through a POST request and populated with each track (through their respective URI). The Node.js backend returns a link to the playlist alongside other relevant data to the client.",
  "The backend is hosted on an AWS EC2 Instance running Linux and persists through the use of Screen GNU. It is accessed through an AWS API Gateway.",
  "Spotlist's frontend and backend feature comprehensive error handling which produce simple and clean error messages for the user.",
  "The entire application is optimised to be lightweight and scores 100% in each of the metrics in Google's Lighthouse Report. It is also a certified Progressive Web Application allowing the application to be downloaded onto a user's device and function similar to a native app."],
