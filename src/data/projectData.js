  longDescription: "Stockle is a static, client-side-only web application built on vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS and SCSS. Stockle was built to function almost identically to the popular game Wordle. Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of coloured tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. Stockle relies on the same concept but rather than using any five-letter word the potential answers are stock tickers of various lengths and the UI and game logic dynamically adjust to the ticker length of the day. The purpose of Stockle is to allow financial market participants and enthusiasts to play a fun and mentally stimulating stock market related game which also exposes them to new stocks and companies they were otherwise unaware of.",

Following the acquisition of the game by the New York Times, a colleague posed the question of the potential complexity and cost associated with the development of such a game. In response, I conveyed that while the concept and implementation of the game were impressive, it was essentially a static web application with pre-loaded daily answers.", "This conversation sparked an idea to develop my own version of the game, with a unique spin. As a finance enthusiast and active participant in various investment communities online, I decided to create a version of the game, named Stockle, that would utilize stock tickers instead of 5 letter words as answers.", "The objectives for this project included the design and implementation of a lightweight static web application that retained all the features of the original Wordle game, while also incorporating additional logic to accommodate the use of varying length stock tickers. Additionally, I aimed to replicate the styling of Wordle to provide a familiar user experience."],

The date-fns package is used to determine the user's timezone and subsequently select the appropriate ticker of the day, referred to as the Stockle. The application features a dynamic user interface and game logic that adapts the number of guess squares based on the Stockle of the day and in turn renders the necessary UI. The user interface includes options for Dark and Light Mode, as well as a High Contrast Mode for individuals with visual impairments. User preferences for the theme are stored in the browser's Local Storage for easy access on future visits.", "The application also includes statistic tracking, such as wins, games played, results, and win streaks, which are stored in the browser's Local Storage for easy tracking without the need for a cumbersome login process that could negatively impact user adoption.

The goal was to create a lightweight Progressive Web App that could be installed on users' devices and connect to their Spotify account. The application would accept a setlist.fm setlist link and use the setlist.fm REST API to retrieve setlist data, including artist, songs, date, and location.

Upon successful authorization, the Express.js server requests an access token from Spotify, which is valid for 30 minutes and is stored for use in subsequent requests to Spotify's API until it expires.", "Secondly, the back-end is called upon when the user attempts to create a playlist. The 'setlist' route receives an HTTP request containing a setlist ID and a Spotify Access token. The setlist.fm REST API is called to retrieve a response containing the necessary data on the user's chosen setlist, which is then parsed and processed through various methods to convert the data into the required format. The Spotify API's Search endpoint is called to retrieve a unique URI for each track. Tracks that were not found on Spotify are added to an object, which is returned to the client along with the playlist. Finally, the playlist is created through a POST request and populated with each track using their respective URI.
